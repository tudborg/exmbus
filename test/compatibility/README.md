This folder contains test cases that test examples from specific devices to check for compatibility.

For a device to be considered "supported", it must have a test file that tests
the examples provided in the manufacturers device manual.

If the manufacturer does not provide such documents, a capture from a real device
can instead be added in it's place. however I strongly prefer an official example.
